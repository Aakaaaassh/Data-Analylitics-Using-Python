We have a data set of a stock which has Date,Close,Open,High,Low and We have an assignment.
The Assignment is given below:
1.) Make an average which has last 21 days close price
2.) Make an average which has last 50 days close price
3.) Give a data set which has all the open == high values.
4.) Give a data set which has all the open == low values.
5.) Make a 20 day SMA (Simple Moving Average) on the full Data.

I have written a code in python to fulfill the assignment which reads the dataset from data.xlsx file and after the code is executed a new assignment.xlsx file will be generated along with the data in it and a 20 day SMA graph will be saved
i am attaching the final code as well jupyter file with input and output.
